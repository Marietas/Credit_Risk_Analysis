# Credit_Risk_Analysis

##Overview

The propose of this project is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge to predict credit risk.
To develop this analysis we have to use different techniques to evaluate models with unbalanced classes, therefore, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries have been applied to build and evaluate models
The final result is to present the performance of these models to check whether they should be used to predict credit risk.using resampling.
