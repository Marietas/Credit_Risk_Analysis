# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The propose of this project is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge to predict credit risk.
To develop this analysis we have to use different techniques to evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Therefore the following models were applied for this analysis:

 - RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms; 
 - ClusterCentroids algorithm;
 - SMOTEENN algorithm; 
 - And finally the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
 
Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries have been applied to build and evaluate models. The final result is to present the performance of these models to check whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
